# Fetch-and-Render
A project through MIT and XPRO. The objective was to fetch data from an API, and implement Pagination so the user could interact with it.

# Installation
1. Download the folder or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root folder in your terminal
3. Run "npm install", then "npm start"

# Usage
Once you open the web page, you'll receive a dog fact! Refresh the page to get a new one.

# Future Improvements
In the future, I'd love to be able to add images along with the facts, and have a new one appear each time the user refreshes.
